# coloring_app

My new Flutter project.

## TODO

The application should:

+ Display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen
+ After tapping anywhere on the screen a background color should be changed to a random color
+ Also add any other feature to the app can be made

Please do not use any external libraries for color generation.
